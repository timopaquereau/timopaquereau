- 👋 Hey, I’m Timothée Paquereau, soon to graduate from a Master's Degree in Applied Mathematics, Statistics and Business Intelligence.
- 👀 I'm driven by data, from collection to visualization. I love learning about new technologies in machine learning and AI.
- 💻 I primarily code in Python for now, with experience in and a desire to explore further R, SQL, and SAS.
- 📁 My projects will be either in French or English, depending on the context, as I am fluent in both.
